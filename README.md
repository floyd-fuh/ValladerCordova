===============

Vallader Romansh - German dictionary app for Android and iOS (currently, as it is Cordova it can be adopted to work on any mobile phone). You can type a word in German or Vallader Romansh and it will display some results from web sources and link to the original results.

Just to make sure we catch all people who search for something like this, in all languages:
Deutsch - Vallader Romanisch
Vallader Romanisch - Deutsch
Tudais-ch - Vallader Rumantsch
Vallader Rumantsch - Tudais-ch

The convention is that everything inside the app visible to the user is Vallader, however, coding and everything code related (like this README) is done in English as usual.

The app is actually not doing much, except for parsing some HTML results (which was tedious) from the following sources:
* http://www.udg.ch/dicziunari/, Uniun Dals Grischs (UDG), www.udg.ch
* http://www.pledari.ch/meinpledari/index.php, MeinPledari, www.pledari.ch/meinpledari/
* http://www.vocabulario.ch/vallader/v0.1/i.php, Vocabulario, www.vocabulario.ch

I hope this will help the very small Vallader community to keep their language so it doesn't die. More information about Vallader: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallader_dialect_(Romansh)
